// The structure for metadata behind a payment or token transfer between two
// parties. This data is considered untrusted as it comes from the client apps
// directly and not from the blockchain. It gives us the intended native
// currencies for the agreed upon exchange between two app users. This data
// cannot be derived from the blockchain alone. We could guess at it, but then
// we would definitely be off by a couple decimal points every now and then when
// reporting the booking cost back to the user.
//
// Note: This is generally unused right now and should be deprecated with the
// new intent system and external data models. There's a few use cases still
// hitting this which, in particular, need to know the order of transfers.
